This workspace is for a modular ECS-based Asteroids game in Rust using Vulkan and GLFW. Use idiomatic Rust, modular design, and separation of concerns for ECS, rendering (2D/3D), input, audio, menus, config, asset loading, and save/load. Support both 2D and 3D assets, persistent settings/scores, and a resources folder for all static assets (models, textures, shaders, audio, fonts, data).
