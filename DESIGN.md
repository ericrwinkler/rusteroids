### Material System Architecture
```rust
pub enum MaterialType {
    StandardPBR,     // Full physically-based rendering
    Unlit,          // Simple unshaded materials (currently active)
    TransparentPBR, // PBR with alpha blending
    TransparentUnlit, // Unshaded with transparency
}

pub struct MaterialManager {
    materials: HashMap<MaterialId, Material>,
    material_ubo_buffers: HashMap<MaterialId, Buffer>,
    // Resource management for unlimited materials
}
```

### Pipeline Management
```rust
pub struct PipelineManager {
    pipelines: HashMap<MaterialType, GraphicsPipeline>,
    active_pipeline: Option<MaterialType>,
    // Efficient pipeline switching without recreation
}
```

### UBO Architecture (Operational)
```glsl
// Set 0: Per-frame data (implemented and working)
layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform CameraUBO {
    mat4 view_matrix;
    mat4 projection_matrix;
    mat4 view_projection_matrix;  // Pre-computed for efficiency
    vec4 camera_position;
    vec4 camera_direction;
    vec2 viewport_size;
    vec2 near_far;
} camera;

layout(set = 0, binding = 1) uniform LightingUBO {
    vec4 ambient_color;
    vec4 directional_light_direction;
    vec4 directional_light_color;
    float light_intensity;
} lighting;

// Set 1: Per-material data (prepared for implementation)
layout(set = 1, binding = 0) uniform MaterialUBO { ... } material;
layout(set = 1, binding = 1) uniform sampler2D base_color_texture;
```
