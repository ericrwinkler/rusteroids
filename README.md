# Rusteroids

A modular ECS-based Asteroids game showcasing a reusable Rust game engine architecture. The project demonstrates clean separation between generic engine components and application-specific game logic.

## Architecture Overview

![Engine Architecture](docs/diagrams/engine_architecture.svg)

The project is structured as two distinct layers:
- **RustEngine**: Generic, reusable game engine components
- **Asteroids Game**: Application-specific implementation using the engine

### Key Features

**Engine Layer:**
- High-performance ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture
- Vulkan-based 3D rendering with 2D support
- Modular asset loading system (models, textures, shaders, audio)
- Cross-platform input handling
- 3D spatial audio system
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Memory-safe resource management with RAII patterns

**Application Layer:**
- Classic Asteroids gameplay mechanics
- Game state management (menus, gameplay, scoring)
- Custom UI system
- Persistent settings and high scores
- Game-specific asset pipeline

## Design Documentation

### Core Architecture Documents
- [**Engine Design**](docs/ENGINE_DESIGN.md) - Complete engine architecture specification
- [**Rendering Design**](docs/DESIGN.md) - Vulkan rendering system design
- [**Project Restructure**](docs/PROJECT_RESTRUCTURE.md) - Multi-crate workspace organization

### Architecture Diagrams

#### Resource Ownership Model
![Resource Ownership](docs/diagrams/resource_ownership.svg)

Our resource management system follows strict ownership rules:
- Single owner per resource (Managers)
- Type-safe handles for borrowing
- RAII patterns for automatic cleanup
- No raw Vulkan handles exposed

#### Module Dependencies
![Module Dependencies](docs/diagrams/module_dependencies.svg)

Clean layered architecture with:
- Clear dependency hierarchy
- No circular dependencies
- Interface-based communication
- Minimal coupling between modules

#### Data Flow Architecture
![Data Flow](docs/diagrams/data_flow.svg)

Unidirectional data flow from game logic to GPU:
- Game Logic â†’ Scene Management â†’ Rendering â†’ Vulkan â†’ GPU
- Error propagation and validation at each layer
- Batched command recording for performance

## Planned Structure (Multi-crate Workspace)

The project will be restructured into a multi-crate workspace:

```
rusteroids/
â”œâ”€â”€ crates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rust_engine/       # Generic engine crate
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ asteroids/         # Game application crate
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ engine_plugins/    # Optional engine plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                 # Development tools
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/             # Assets (engine + game)
â””â”€â”€ docs/                  # All documentation
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Engine provides generic functionality, application implements game-specific logic
2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Engine abstractions impose no runtime overhead
3. **Memory Safety**: All resources managed through RAII and Rust's ownership system
4. **Performance First**: Designed for real-time gaming performance requirements
5. **Modularity**: Each subsystem can be used independently
6. **Testability**: Clean interfaces enable comprehensive testing

## Performance Goals

- **60 FPS** stable frame rate on target hardware
- **Sub-1ms** frame time variance
- **Minimal memory allocation** during gameplay
- **Efficient GPU utilization** through command batching
- **Scalable architecture** supporting complex scenes
