//! Lighting system for realistic 3D scene illumination
//! 
//! This module provides a comprehensive lighting system supporting multiple light types
//! and complex lighting environments. Designed to work with PBR materials for
//! physically accurate lighting calculations.
//! 
//! # Architecture Assessment: GOOD DESIGN WITH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
//! 
//! This module demonstrates solid architectural principles with backend-agnostic design
//! and a focus on lighting domain expertise. However, there are some areas where the
//! current implementation could be enhanced.
//! 
//! ## Architectural Strengths:
//! 
//! ### Backend Independence ✅
//! The lighting system contains no references to specific rendering backends. Light
//! definitions are pure mathematical constructs that can be interpreted by any renderer,
//! whether Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX, or software rendering.
//! 
//! ### Comprehensive Light Types ✅
//! Supports the three fundamental light types needed for realistic 3D scenes:
//! - **Directional**: Parallel light rays (sun, distant light sources)
//! - **Point**: Omnidirectional light from a point (light bulbs, fires)
//! - **Spot**: Directional cone of light (flashlights, stage lighting)
//! 
//! ### Physically Meaningful Parameters ✅
//! Light properties correspond to real-world lighting concepts:
//! - Position and direction for spatial light placement
//! - Color and intensity for light appearance and brightness  
//! - Range for light attenuation and performance optimization
//! - Cone angles for spot light beam shaping
//! 
//! ### Lighting Environment Abstraction ✅
//! The `LightingEnvironment` provides a higher-level abstraction for managing
//! multiple lights and ambient lighting as a cohesive scene lighting setup.
//! 
//! ### Preset Lighting Configurations ✅
//! Includes realistic preset lighting environments (indoor warm, outdoor daylight)
//! that provide good starting points for different scene types.
//! 
//! ## Current Implementation Limitations:
//! 
//! ### Limited Shader Integration
//! **RENDERER COUPLING ISSUE**: The renderer currently only supports directional lights
//! in the shader push constants, despite this module defining point and spot lights.
//! This creates a mismatch between the high-level lighting API and actual rendering
//! capabilities.
//! 
//! **FIXME in renderer**: Extend shader system to support all defined light types
//! or clearly document which light types are supported by each rendering backend.
//! 
//! ### No Shadow Support
//! Current light definitions don't include shadow-related properties:
//! - Shadow casting enable/disable flags
//! - Shadow map resolution preferences
//! - Shadow bias and filtering parameters
//! 
//! ### Missing Advanced Lighting Features
//! - **Area lights**: For realistic soft shadows from extended light sources
//! - **Image-based lighting**: For realistic environment reflections
//! - **Light probes**: For baked global illumination
//! - **Volumetric lighting**: For atmospheric effects (fog, dust, god rays)
//! 
//! ## Performance and Optimization Opportunities:
//! 
//! ### Light Culling Support
//! Light definitions could include bounding volume information to support
//! efficient light culling in renderers:
//! ```rust
//! pub struct Light {
//!     // ... existing fields ...
//!     pub bounding_sphere: Option<BoundingSphere>, // For culling
//!     pub priority: u32, // For importance-based light selection
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### GPU Layout Considerations
//! For GPU-based lighting calculations, consider memory layout optimization:
//! - Structure-of-arrays layout for better GPU cache usage
//! - Explicit padding for GPU alignment requirements
//! - Separate storage for frequently vs rarely changed light data
//! 
//! ### Dynamic Light Management
//! Large scenes need efficient dynamic light management:
//! - Spatial data structures for light queries
//! - Level-of-detail for distant lights
//! - Temporal stability for animated lights
//! 
//! ## Future Enhancement Areas:
//! 
//! ### Advanced Light Types
//! ```rust
//! pub enum LightType {
//!     Directional,
//!     Point,
//!     Spot,
//!     Area { width: f32, height: f32 },           // Soft area lighting
//!     Environment { texture: TextureHandle },      // IBL environment maps
//!     Probe { position: Vec3, influence: f32 },   // Light probes for GI
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Shadow Configuration
//! ```rust
//! pub struct ShadowSettings {
//!     pub cast_shadows: bool,
//!     pub shadow_resolution: u32,
//!     pub shadow_bias: f32,
//!     pub shadow_filter: ShadowFilter,
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Light Animation System
//! Support for animated lights with interpolation:
//! - Keyframe-based light animation
//! - Procedural light effects (flickering, pulsing)
//! - Light scripting for complex behaviors
//! 
//! ## Design Goals Assessment:
//! 
//! 1. ✅ **Backend Agnostic**: No rendering backend dependencies
//! 2. ✅ **Physically Accurate**: Real-world lighting parameters
//! 3. ✅ **Easy to Use**: Builder patterns and preset configurations
//! 4. ⚠️ **Feature Complete**: Missing some advanced lighting features
//! 5. ⚠️ **Performance Optimized**: Could benefit from GPU layout consideration
//! 
//! Overall, this is a solid foundation for a lighting system that follows good
//! architectural principles and can be extended to support advanced lighting features
//! as the rendering system evolves.
