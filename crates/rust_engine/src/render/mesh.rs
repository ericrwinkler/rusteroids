//! Mesh representation for 3D models
//! 
//! This module provides 3D geometry data structures and management for rendering.
//! Contains vertex definitions and mesh primitives for use with the rendering system.
//! 
//! # Architecture Issues and Design Notes
//! 
//! ## Current State: MIXED ABSTRACTION LEVELS
//! This module mixes high-level mesh concepts with low-level Vulkan implementation details.
//! While the core `Mesh` and vertex data structures are backend-agnostic, the `Vertex` 
//! implementation contains Vulkan-specific methods that violate library design principles.
//! 
//! ## Library-Agnostic Design Violations:
//! 
//! ### CRITICAL ISSUE: Vulkan Coupling in Vertex Structure
//! The `Vertex` struct contains methods like `get_binding_description()` and 
//! `get_attribute_descriptions()` that return Vulkan-specific types. This creates
//! a direct dependency on the Vulkan backend at the high-level API layer.
//! 
//! **FIXME: Move Vulkan-specific vertex layout information to backend module**
//! - `Vertex` should be a pure data structure with no backend dependencies
//! - Vulkan vertex input state should be handled in `vulkan/` module
//! - Consider trait-based approach: `impl VulkanVertex for Vertex` in backend
//! 
//! ### Asset Loading Integration
//! The `Mesh` struct implements the `Asset` trait but with incomplete functionality.
//! This suggests an intention for proper asset pipeline integration that needs completion.
//! 
//! **FIXME: Complete asset loading implementation**
//! - Implement OBJ/glTF file format support
//! - Add proper error handling for malformed mesh data
//! - Consider streaming/LOD support for large meshes
//! 
//! ## Performance Considerations:
//! 
//! ### Memory Layout
//! The current vertex structure uses separate arrays for positions, normals, and
//! texture coordinates. While this is standard, it may not be optimal for all
//! rendering backends or usage patterns.
//! 
//! ### Mesh Storage
//! Meshes currently store vertex/index data directly in vectors. For performance-
//! critical applications, consider:
//! - GPU-resident mesh storage with handles
//! - Compressed vertex formats where appropriate
//! - Mesh instancing support for repeated geometry
//! 
//! ## Recommended Refactoring:
//! 
//! 1. **Separate Backend Concerns**: Move all Vulkan-specific code to backend module
//! 2. **Complete Asset Integration**: Implement proper mesh loading from files  
//! 3. **Add Validation**: Ensure mesh data integrity (valid indices, normalized normals)
//! 4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider GPU-resident storage and instancing
//! 
//! ## Design Goals for Library Version:
//! - Pure data structures with no backend dependencies
//! - Complete asset loading pipeline integration
//! - Flexible vertex attribute system supporting various backends
//! - Efficient memory usage and GPU resource management

/// The `Mesh` struct follows good library design principles by being backend-agnostic

/// - GPU-resident mesh storage with handle-based access
/// - Level-of-detail (LOD) support for distance-based mesh switching

/// - Bounding box/sphere calculation for frustum culling
