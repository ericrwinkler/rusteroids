## 📊 Technical Status

### Current System Capabilities
```rust
// Working material system architecture
MaterialType: StandardPBR | Unlit | TransparentPBR | TransparentUnlit

// Working pipeline management
PipelineManager {
    StandardPBR: GraphicsPipeline,
    Unlit: GraphicsPipeline,         // ← Currently active
    TransparentPBR: GraphicsPipeline,
    TransparentUnlit: GraphicsPipeline,
}

// Working UBO system
Set 0: {
    Binding 0: CameraUBO,    // View/projection matrices, camera data
    Binding 1: LightingUBO,  // Directional light data
}
Set 1: MaterialUBO (prepared for future)
```

### Application Performance
- **Frame Rate**: Smooth 60+ FPS with teapot rendering (18,960 vertices)
- **Memory**: Efficient Vulkan resource management with RAII cleanup
- **Validation**: Clean Vulkan validation (only performance warnings about small allocations)
- **Resize Handling**: Perfect aspect ratio maintenance during window operations
